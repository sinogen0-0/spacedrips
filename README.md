Repository for Ableton live sets/packs/instruments/samples -Please make sure to organize into aptly named subfolders, i.e. "instruments" or "samples" or "live sets"

USING LIVE 10.0.1, if you have a more up to date version you should uninstall then re-install version 10.0.1
-It'll be the easiest to keep working, and it has all the features of live 10.

To Use:
-Download the zip of the repository, then unzip in chosen location on computer
-open ableton, and import folder by using "collections" tab on left side
-press "Add folder..." and point it to unzipped repository

To Pack:
-Right click the project you're working on, and hit "Manage Project"
-Use right side window pane/tab to manage external file use, make sure that the collect settings are set to "Yes"
-click collect and save
-Re-open manage project window, and hit create pack if there are no missing files, external files, and no unused files
-DO NOT UPLOAD JUNK UNUSED FILES: You'll be able to see every "2hr shit forgot to stop recording" file in the "Unused Files" tab. Delete those first before packing or collecting and saving. If you bloat the repo I will be mad, and so will your CPU.
