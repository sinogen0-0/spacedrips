This is the repository for my house music project, will upload all samples + midi instruments + live sets here.
Feel free to download the repo and import the un-zipped folder into your ableton

USING LIVE 10.0.1, if you have a more up to date version you should uninstall then re-install version 10.0.1
-It'll be the easiest to keep working, and it has all the features of live 10.
